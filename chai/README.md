# chai configuration
- .includeStack is false by default — if we want to see the full stack trace, we can set this to true.
- Similarly, .showDiff flag — is to include or exclude differences thrown by the assertion error. By default, it will be true.
- Lastly, truncateThreshold flag — this is to control the actual and expected values in the assertion errors. The default value is 40. We can set to 0 if we want to disable truncating.
